# Pull-Through Cache Cost Summary

## Quick Answer

**Should you implement ECR pull-through cache?**  
✅ **YES** - It will save you money starting from day one.

## Cost Impact

### Within AWS Free Tier (First 12 Months)

- **Additional cost**: **$0.00**
- **Savings**: $0.18 - $1.50/month
- **Net benefit**: Positive ROI immediately

### After AWS Free Tier

- **Additional cost**: ~**$0.04/month** (storage)
- **Savings**: $0.22 - $1.50/month (faster builds)
- **Net savings**: $0.18 - $1.46/month

## The Math

Based on your current configuration:

- **3 builds/day** (90/month) at **8 minutes/build**
- CodeBuild cost: $0.005/minute
- Base image: 80 MB (debian:bookworm-slim)

### Without Cache

```
Monthly cost: $3.60 (CodeBuild only)
Build time: 8 minutes (including 30-60s for image pull)
Risks: Docker Hub rate limits, slower pulls
```

### With Cache

```
Monthly cost: $3.42 total
  - CodeBuild: $3.38 (7.5 min builds, 45s saved per build)
  - ECR storage: $0.04 (5 cached images = 400 MB)
Net savings: $0.18/month
Benefits: No rate limits, 3-4x faster pulls
```

## Hidden Value

Beyond the monetary savings:

1. **Reliability**: No Docker Hub downtime or rate limit failures
2. **Speed**: 45-60 seconds saved per build = faster iteration
3. **Developer Experience**: Faster CI/CD = happier developers
4. **Future-Proof**: Scales well as you increase build frequency

## Decision Matrix

| Build Frequency | Monthly Savings | Yearly Savings | Recommendation          |
| --------------- | --------------- | -------------- | ----------------------- |
| 1-2 builds/day  | $0.05 - $0.10   | $0.60 - $1.20  | ✅ Implement            |
| 3-5 builds/day  | $0.18 - $0.30   | $2.16 - $3.60  | ✅ Implement            |
| 10+ builds/day  | $0.70 - $1.50   | $8.40 - $18.00 | ✅ Definitely implement |

## Calculator

For your specific usage, run:

```bash
./scripts/calculate-cache-costs.sh
```

This interactive calculator will:

- Ask about your build frequency
- Calculate exact costs for your scenario
- Show monthly and yearly savings
- Provide a clear recommendation

## Bottom Line

**Cost**: Essentially free (within free tier) or ~$0.04/month after  
**Savings**: $0.18 - $1.50/month in reduced build time  
**ROI**: Immediate (saves money from day one)  
**Risk**: None (can be removed if not beneficial)  
**Recommendation**: ✅ **Implement immediately**
